Speaker and listener *and literal* (i.e. make sure listener knows that speaker knows that listener knows...) have in common ground:
	* ☑ probability_of_cause
	* ☑ probability_of_causal_variable
	* ☑ causal_structure_prior
	* ☑ actual states of A, B, and E

Speaker knows:
	* ☑ causal_structure.AE
	* ☑ causal_structure.BE

## Interpretation Model:

Given "E because A," estimate causal_structure.AE and causal_structure.BE.

## Speaker Model:

Given causal_structure.AE and causal_structure.BE, endorse "E because A," (binary "yes" or "no").

Or maybe given a set of alternative explanations, pick one?

## Unknowns:

stickiness parameter

## Fixed unknowns:

* lexical presuppositions/entailments (but this is OK if common ground is fixed)
* QUD is cause, because that's the only unknown for the listener
* alternative utterances / alternative explanations
