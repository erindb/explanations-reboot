Speaker and listener have in common ground:
	* probability_of_cause
	* probability_of_causal_variable
	* causal_structure_prior
	* actual states of A, B, and E

Speaker knows:
	* causal_structure.AE
	* causal_structure.BE

## Interpretation Model:

Given "E because A," estimate causal_structure.AE and causal_structure.BE.

## Speaker Model:

Given causal_structure.AE and causal_structure.BE, endorse "E because A," (binary "yes" or "no").
