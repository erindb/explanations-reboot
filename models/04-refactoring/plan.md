idea:
0. write a straightforward program
1. determine variable to explain
2. write counterfactual priors for some variables in the program
3. make CF-able variables independent of one another
4. enumerate (actually) true expressions on those CF-able and causally downstream variables
5. score expressions on CF difference-making on variable to explain
