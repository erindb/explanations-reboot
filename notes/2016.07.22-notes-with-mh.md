Is there a better way to visualize this information?
Anything pop out as interesting and/or odd?
	* "I don't care about X" is not an equally good explanation as "I do care about X". If I don't care about anything and you ask me why I did that, I should say, "because I don't care" or "because I chose randomly". Explaining with "I don't care about X"
	* Which utilities should you choose to explain in terms of? Brownies 01, 10, 11. When do yo explain in terms of A vs B utilities and how to negations play into that. When do you explain in terms of things that have low utility.
	* try faceting by object we chose. code explanation as high utility component or low utility component. make it clear what the total utility is.
What other extensions should I try?
	* what if there are tons of cupcake like things and one brownie
	* not sure negative utilities makes sense. cause like, do people really have priors over utility coefficients maybe i really like it maybe i really hate it? Or do they tend to think, "maybe you care maybe you don't, but if you care it's probably negative."
	* it would be good to understand why the exhaustive explanation is somethings not as good as a specific one
