* Ask people who know about explanation: "What are the top 5 papers on explanation?"
* Search twitter for explanations of events (e.g. Orlando shooting) that people disagree about. Do they have different models of the situation? Are they using different stickiness of counterfactuals? Could potentially search twitter for hashtag and keyword ("because")
* When we get data back, can we differentiate between data-level responses, latent-variable-level responses, and causal-model-level responses? (technically, causal model responses are just higher level latent variables, unless stickiness affects them differently...)
* Have an example on hand of where the correlational information is the same, but the underlying causal structure is different.
