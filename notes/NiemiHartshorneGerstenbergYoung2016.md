Basic task:

* "Bob killed Alice because..."
* is the next word "he" or "she"?

Answers correlate with answers that communicate beliefs like:

* Would Alice have been killed by someone else?
* Would Bob have killed someone else?
* Did Alice have control over the occurence of the event?
* Did Alice let the event happen?
* Could Alice have deserved the event?

And also relate to scores based on a questionnaire about different kinds of sexism when *"Male harmed Female because..."* but not when the verb had nothing to do with harm. A little unsure about the stats here, there's a comparison where for one class a predictor is significant and for the other it's not, why not report the interaction, too? But findings seem straightforward and definitely a good example of explanations and beliefs being closely related.
