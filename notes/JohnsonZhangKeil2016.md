A paper on irrationality in explanations but not in decision-making.

The bias: if there are exactly 2 possible explanations with equal prior probability, people prefer explanations that wouldn't give rise to unusual evidence. Even when their perception of the unusual evidence is completely occluded, so they have no idea whether it's there or not.

This bias goes away when they're asked to make a decision of what to do that depends on the explanation. They choose one of two solutions an equal amount of the time.

Maybe there's another explanation competing with the one that implies the unusual evidence. If that were the case, then there would be an asymmetry between the two explanations the experimenter considers. But then in the decision-making task, it's crystal clear that there are exactly two options. The alternative explanation could be "It's this thing that usually would look like this, but we can't see it." So like, the cause combined with the obscuring of the evidence. And you don't need to mention obscured common things, so only the unusual evidence example has this possible explanation competing. Like, it feels like a weird coincidence that the evidence would be there, but completely occluded, and like that should be mentioned. In the explanation version, maybe that's an option of what to say.
