tl;dr
Some DVs for explanatory goodness. Overall, goodness of explanation is closely tied to P(explanandum|explanans). In these experiments, base rates of explanans were neglected by participants.

Some questions they asked:
* How does probabilistic information affect explanatory judgements? Answer: in the way you'd expect...?
* Are explanatory and abductive inference the same kind of inference? Answer: how is this addressed in this paper?

Some variables:
* Explanatory value
* Rational acceptability
* Entailment

Virtues of explanations:
* simplicity
* generalizability
* "sense of understanding"

Statistical relevance but not base rates determined explanatory value.

Two possible explanations (urns, medical treatment, cabs in a city)

* "logical implication" H logically implies D.
* "causal relevance" H specifies the cause of D.
* "confirmation" H is confirmed by D.
* "posterior probability" H is probable given D.
* "explanatory power" H explains that D.
* "increase in understanding" H provides understanding about D.
* "truth" H is true.

Varied factors:
* statistical relevance
* prior probability

Authors ran PCA to get 3 features:
* Explanatory value (causal power)
* Confirmation "rational acceptability" (is the hypothesis likely?)
* Entailment

Some ANOVAs:
* statistical relevance -- causal P(D|H) -- significantly related to "explanatory value" and "rational acceptability" and "entailment"
* prior probability of hypothesis didn't matter to anything, which makes sense in light of other research on "base rate neglect" and inference of causal models
