**Question:** Sometimes we want explanations (we're puzzled, curious, aware that we might not understand something). Other times it doesn't occur to us that an explanation is required. What distinguishes those situations?

**Claim:** Salience of some counterfactual alternative to reality is necessary for this kind of curiosity.

Here's a quote about the counterfactual difference making notion that I'm currently modeling:

> Let {Si} be an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive possible states of the system of which S∗ is a member... . Degrees of explanatory power are relevant to the force with which the explanation resolves the puzzlement: why S∗ rather than something else? (Skyrms [1980], pp. 140–1)

**Claim:** Categories matter in the formulation of counterfactual alternatives.

> I ... want to suggest ... that the real source of the need for explanation ... can ... be traced to our awareness that other things of this kind ... have different masses, so in order to understand why the tau has the particular mass it does rather than another mass that -- as an instance of this kind -- it might have had, we need to know what it is that differentiates the tau from other elementary particles. More briefly, we want to know what the difference between the tau’s mass and the masses of the other elementary particles depends on.

> the possibilities that are relevant to us are ... often tied to our sense of what sort of capacities a thing has, relative to the kind of thing it is

**Definition:** Grimm introduces a notion of **proto-understanding**, the sorts of possibilities or "foils" (to facts) that are live w.r.t. a situation. In our case, this is analogous to the prior we're using to counterfactualize over.
