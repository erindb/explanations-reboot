* Experiments:
	1. elicit things to explain with emotions
	2. elicit explanations for those things
* Clustered events by ratings of what kinds of explanations are good
	- k means with bootstrap clustering stability analyses (Hennig 2007)
* Emotions influence actions. How?
	- by influencing beliefs
	- by influencing desires
	- somehow directly influencing the action, e.g. "rash" decisions
		* (e.g. maybe by changing lambda or recursion)
