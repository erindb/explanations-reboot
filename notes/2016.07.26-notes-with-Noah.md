how to sample from categorical
so that exogenous randomness carries over properly into counterfactual
related to metropolis hastings categorical variables
so if probability of chosen choice stays the same and the exogenous randomness, the choice stays the same
series of binary choices

***make sure to try everything with softmax!!
***figure out counterfactual sampler
	* if we use CDF (all options there, some 0s)
	* run simulations, changing order of categorical elements
	* directly and its effect on explanations
