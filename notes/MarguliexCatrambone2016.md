tl;dr Have students label subgoals. Give them hints about how to do that XOR show them your answer. Not both.

subgoal labels are teleological explanations

*Constructing* ideas with minimal hints leads to better learning than passive learning, no hints, or too many hints.

Supporting independent learning: subgoal learning and self-explanation.

Subgoal-oriented instructions (like worked examples) can be helpful in learning, especially to solve STEM problems. Subgoal learning supports generalization.

To promote subgoal learning, you can add a task "subgoal labelling", abstract function-based explanations of steps.

Passive: receive information
Active: receive and record information or follow along physically somehow
Constructive: fill in gaps, connect to prior knowledge, etc.
Interactive: discuss, collaborate with other students

Interactive and Constructive learning are the most effective. Passive is least effective.

Experiment:
* program in Android App Inventor (drag and drop)
* Passive: subgoal labels given
* Active: multiple choice subgoal labels
* Constructive: participants make their own subgoals (they received training for this. control training for active and passive was in analogies)
	* Guided Constructive: solution steps grouped by subgoal.
	* Guided Constructive with hints: same, but with hints about what things in the same category had in common.
	* Unguided Constructive: no preclustering
* existence of feedback on all tasks was varied and was realized as a model of a correct answer to compare to their own.
