A talk relating to cause at CogSci2016

Impossibility, plausibility, and magic
Their studies (Adults, within and between Ss, kids within)
In the world of Harry Potter, which spells are more difficult?
Conclusion:
people have strong intuitions of which impossible things are more plausible, and those intuitions preserve propteries and causal connections of the real world. Kids preserve these properties more in their ratings of spell difficulty more as they get older.

Should I go to the talk: meh. pretty straightforward study. It would probably be cute, though.
