# explanations-reboot
because the big bang

Trying to articulate a model of explanations ("B because A") that uses counterfactual probabilities in the semantics,
an arbitrary probabilistic program as the background knowledge,
and an RSA-style interpertation of explanations.

What can we learn about the semantics (and pragmatics?) of explanatory utterances,
about the alternative causal structures that might be salient for a given context and explanation,
or about the variety of inferences that people make given an explanation?
