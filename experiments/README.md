The 2015 experiments were based directly on Lucas & Kemp (2015). in the counterfactuals version, we elicited counterfactual probabilities, the way they did. In the explanations version, we elicited ratings for explanations. Experiment 1 is a more complete version of the explanations rating elicitation design. Participants were paid $0.80 for participation.

In experiment0 we gave participants videos (excerpts from animated shorts) to watch and asked them questions about the video: "X happened becuase ...".

In experiment1, we asked participants to rate all possible explanations "X because Y" for the states of the hormones in the L&K style experiment. Participants were paid $1 for participation.
