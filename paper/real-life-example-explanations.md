# Real-life Examples of Explanations

## 1.

**Context:** A game mostly of chance: Bao (a Vietnamese game kind of like President). If you're inexperienced, you can easily make poor choices, and if you do, you will not win. If you make good choices, it's less definitive. You might win, or you might get dealt really bad hands and so lose anyway. If you don't make poor choices, but also don't make good choices, it's a toss up whether or not you will win. So making poor choices is sufficient for losing. Making good choices is not sufficient for winning. Neither is necessary for winning or losing.

**Utterance 1:** I'm losing because I made poor choices.

**Utterance 2:** I won by chance. It wasn't because I made good choices.

How are these both true?

Let's look at utterance 1. Here are some equivalent statements (by hypothesis):

1. I'm losing because I made poor choices.
2. If I hadn't made poor choices, I wouldn't be losing. And I'm losing.
3. If I hadn't made the poor choices I made, I wouldn't be losing as badly as I am. And I'm losing.
4. Poor choices are necessary for losing. And I'm losing.

Let's look at utterance 2. Here are some equivalent statements (by hypothesis):

1. I'm winning because I made good choices.
2. If I hadn't made good choices, I wouldn't be winning. And I'm winning.
3. If I hadn't made the good choices I made, I wouldn't be winning as much as I am. And I'm winning.
4. Good choices are necessary for winning. And I'm winning.

Sufficiency seems to matter more than necessity here. However, I actually think statment 3 in each of these lists is more true for utterance 1 than for utterance 2. If I didn't make the poor choices I made, I would have made other poor choices. And I would probably still have lost. If I didn't make the good choices I made, I don't think I would have made other equally good choices, and the good choices I made happened to be at lucky times (Robert made a particularly bad choice at the same time as one of my good choices). So I probably would not have won by as much as I did.
